# Revenge Pop Clone (Mako)

This project is a React application that uses Beam for animations and Redux for state management. The goal is to attempt to recreate the website [Revenge Pop](https://revenge-pop.mikapikazo.info/) by Mika Pikazo.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone this repository and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/CSCairney-GL/mako.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd mako
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application on your local development server. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```shell
npm start
```

The development server should automatically open a new browser window/tab. If it doesn't, you can manually open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

You can explore the application and interact with it just like the original [Revenge Pop](https://revenge-pop.mikapikazo.info/) website. Experiment with the Beam animations and Redux state management to see how the website's functionality was recreated.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the React application.
  - `modules/`: Contains segments of the code base region specific.
  - `modules/common`: Contains components that are shared across the code base.
  - `assets`: Contains branding and images.
  - `pages` : Contains the main component pages and react App Router main router.
